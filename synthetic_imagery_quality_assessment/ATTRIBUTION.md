# Attribution & Citation

This reproducibility package re-uses design choices and code structure inspired by the
DisasterGAN Kaggle kernel:

**Adhoppin. "DisasterGAN — Generating Post-Disaster Images"** (Kaggle kernel).
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/adhoppin/disastergan-generating-post-disaster-images

Please credit this kernel if you use portions of its configuration, architecture, or training procedure.

## Suggested citation text

If you use this code for academic work, please cite the original DisasterGAN kernel and the XBD dataset:

- XBD dataset (Stanford): see the XBD / xView2 repository for the dataset citation.

Example (adapt to paper's citation format):

> We base our implementation on the DisasterGAN configuration introduced by Adhoppin (Kaggle kernel, 2020) and evaluate on the XBD dataset (Stanford XBD / xView2).
